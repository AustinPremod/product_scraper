# Project Overview
The provided codebase is a Ruby on Rails application designed for managing and displaying product information. It includes functionality for scraping product details from external websites, exposing an API endpoint to retrieve product data, and providing a web interface for administrators to manage products.

# Components
ProductsController (API Endpoint)

Responsible for handling API requests related to product data.
Defines the scraped_data action to fetch product details from a given URL.
Utilizes caching to improve performance by storing and retrieving product data.

ProductScraperService

Service class responsible for scraping product details from external URLs.
Uses Nokogiri for HTML parsing to extract various attributes such as title, description, price, etc., from the webpage.
Invoked by the ProductsController to fetch product details.

Product Model

Represents a product entity in the application's database.
Includes a method scrape_product_details to interact with the ProductScraperService and save scraped product details to the database.
Defines attributes such as title, description, price, category, contact info, size, etc.

ActiveAdmin Resource for Product

Provides a web interface for administrators to manage products.
Allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products through a user-friendly interface.
Configured with permitted parameters for product attributes.

Gemfile

Lists all dependencies (gems) required by the Rails application.
Includes gems for ActiveAdmin, Devise, Nokogiri, etc., along with other development and testing gems.

Devise Configuration

Configures Devise, a flexible authentication solution for Rails applications.
Defines settings and options for authentication mechanisms such as database_authenticatable, rememberable, and validatable.
Sets up features like password reset, remember me, etc.

Migration to Create Products Table

Database migration to create a products table with columns for various product attributes such as title, description, price, etc.
Specifies data types and constraints for each column.

# Functionality

Scraping Product Data: The application can scrape product details from external websites by providing a URL.
API Endpoint: Exposes an API endpoint (/api/v1/products/scraped_data) to fetch product data by passing a URL as a parameter.
Caching: Utilizes caching to store and retrieve product data, improving performance by avoiding redundant scraping.
Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly web interface powered by ActiveAdmin for administrators to manage products.
Authentication: Uses Devise for user authentication, allowing administrators to log in and access the admin interface securely.
